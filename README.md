## About

Discord bot for AR Club's Discord Server. This bot will send weekly guild leaderboards of various types to the Discord server via webhook. Leaderboards may include: most number of mounts, most wins in Arenas/Battlegrounds, etc. For leaderboards in most wins in Arenas/Battlegrounds, this will be reset weekly at some particular date.
